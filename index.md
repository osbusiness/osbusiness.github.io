# Exploring open source in business

The growth of open source methodology as a successful process for software development, content creation, and hardware engineering is one of the best technological stories of the 21st Century. Merging those creative processes successfully with business practices has, at times, proven to be challenging, but by no means impossible.

The Open Source in Business webinar series intends to bridge this gap by providing a vendor-neutral forum to discuss the business of open source. The series will examine companies who release software as open source and make money by using that software, rather than by selling it. Participants will hear from services companies that have grown organically by specializing in support and solutions around niche open source projects. Sessions will explore how successful consortia help define and grow a marketplace around popular open source projects. Venture capital partners will share what they look for in successful high-growth businesses, and how open source can play a role in those companies.

Join us for interactive sessions and discussions that explore the inflection point between open source and business, and discover how success in open source business happens.

## Next episode: Open Source Hardware

**Time:** December 8th, 2020, 7:00pm CET/1:00pm EST/10:00am PST  
**Featured speakers:** Alicia Gibb, Limor Fried, Jason Kridner  
**Host:** Dave Neary

We are rounding out our first season of Open Source in Business
with a discussion of a business model that depends on open source,
but does not involve the sale of software: Open Hardware companies.

This week, Dave Neary is joined by Limor Fried of Adafruit, Alicia
Gibb of the Open Source Hardware Association, and Jason Kridner,
co-founder of the BeagleBoard.org project. We will discuss the
role that open source software development has played in enabling
an open hardware community to develop, and the role that open
source software plays in the economics of open hardware companies. 

This episode is our last episode of season 1! We will return with
a second season in the Spring.

## Watch our last episode on demand: Why I won't start a company around Envoy

**Time:** December 1st, 2020, 8:30pm CET/2:30pm EST/11:30am PST  
**Featured speaker:** Matt Klein  
**Featured host:** Matt Asay  

We are taking a week off for US Thanksgiving, and returning on
December 1st with Matt Asay interviewing Matt Klein about his
decision *not* to create a company around his very successful
and popular project, Envoy.

Many successful open source projects are created internally to
solve problems for a large company. Of these successful projects,
several project founders decide to start companies around the
commercialization of the project. But there are also project
founders who consciously decide not to go that route. 

Matt Klein, a software engineer with Lyft, wrote Envoy to scratch
a proverbial itch, to solve some of the problems of running
scalable distributed applications. After the project was open
sourced in 2016, it has had huge influence and traction,
including being adopted by the service mesh platform Istio.

In this episode, Matt will chat with guest host Matt Asay about
some of the reasons why [he has chosen not to strike out on his
own](https://medium.com/@mattklein123/optimizing-impact-why-i-will-not-start-an-envoy-platform-company-8904286658cb)
and attempt to create a service mesh business around his project.
