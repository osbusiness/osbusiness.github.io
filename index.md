# Exploring open source in business

The growth of open source methodology as a successful process for software development, content creation, and hardware engineering is one of the best technological stories of the 21st Century. Merging those creative processes successfully with business practices has, at times, proven to be challenging, but by no means impossible.

The Open Source in Business webinar series intends to bridge this gap by providing a vendor-neutral forum to discuss the business of open source. The series will examine companies who release software as open source and make money by using that software, rather than by selling it. Participants will hear from services companies that have grown organically by specializing in support and solutions around niche open source projects. Sessions will explore how successful consortia help define and grow a marketplace around popular open source projects. Venture capital partners will share what they look for in successful high-growth businesses, and how open source can play a role in those companies.

Join us for interactive sessions and discussions that explore the inflection point between open source and business, and discover how success in open source business happens.

## Next Episode: Bootstrapping a Self-funded Open Source Company

**Time:** November 3rd, 2020, 4pm CET/11am EST/8am PST  
**Featured speakers:** Alison Gianotto, Roberto Galoppini

One common path for open source businesses is to start with a small number of
individual contributors, and self-fund the company. This week, Dave Neary will
explore this theme with two people who have taken different paths to starting a
business around an open source project, Alison Gianotto and Roberto Galoppini.

Alison Gianotto founded Grokability in 2015. The company is self-funded, and
its main product is a SaaS solution based on the open source project Snipe-IT,
developed by Alison.

After a career at Sourceforge.net, Roberto Galoppini started his own company
to help popular open source projects including Filezilla to create a
sustainable revenue model.

We will talk about the challenges of moving from an individual contributor to
a CEO role, growing a company organically and reaching profitability as
quickly as possible, and the revenue streams that are available to projects
in different stages of their life, and in different market segments.
