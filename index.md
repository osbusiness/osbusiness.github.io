# Exploring open source in business

The growth of open source methodology as a successful process for software development, content creation, and hardware engineering is one of the best technological stories of the 21st Century. Merging those creative processes successfully with business practices has, at times, proven to be challenging, but by no means impossible.

The Open Source in Business webinar series intends to bridge this gap by providing a vendor-neutral forum to discuss the business of open source. The series will examine companies who release software as open source and make money by using that software, rather than by selling it. Participants will hear from services companies that have grown organically by specializing in support and solutions around niche open source projects. Sessions will explore how successful consortia help define and grow a marketplace around popular open source projects. Venture capital partners will share what they look for in successful high-growth businesses, and how open source can play a role in those companies.

Join us for interactive sessions and discussions that explore the inflection point between open source and business, and discover how success in open source business happens.

## This Week's Episode: The Labor Economics of Open Source

**Time:** October 13th, 2020, 4pm CEST/11am EDT/8am PDT  
**Featured speakers:** Dirk Riehle, Alyssa Wright

Description: Open source is changing how software is built and how money is made. Open
source also defines a new developer career that is independent of the traditional career
within companies. Researcher Dirk Riehle and Alyssa Wright of the Open Collective will
lead a discussion about this new career, and will argue that it creates economic value
for some while it makes life harder for others. Suggesting that such a career is
worthwhile, the talk then discusses key skills that a developer should possess or train
in order to be successful in open source projects. We will also discuss how creators of
successful open source can develop a plan to earn a living while working on their
project.
