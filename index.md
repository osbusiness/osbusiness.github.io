title: About the Open Source Business Summit
---

The Open Source Business Summit is a community-organized, virtual event, with the goal 
of exploring the relationship between businesses and open source projects. We will
explore what it means to be a successful open source company, what types of companies
are most likely to benefit from taking Venture Capital investment, and what types of
companies will do better with organic growth. We will discuss how projects can give
users confidence to deploy their software in mission critical applications, and how
non-profits can play a role in developing a commercial ecosystem around an open
source project.

As a 100% virtual event by design, we will not be tied to a specific timezone - our
goal is to make pre-recorded presentations from industry experts available regularly,
and to focus real-time scheduled sessions on interactive discussions and debates,
moderated Q&A, and watch parties, where viewers will interact with each other, 
event organizers, and speakers in real time.

We will host live sessions in timezones friendly for viewers from the Urals to the
Pacific. And if you can't attend live, don't worry, we will be posting content live
immediately after the event.

Stay tuned for more details of the live talk schedule, including topics, speakers,
registration, and viewing details.
