## Episode 3: The Labor Economics of Open Source
Time: October 13th, 2020, 4pm CEST/11am EDT/8am PDT/
Featuring: Dirk Riehle

Description: Open source is changing how software is built and how money is made. Open
source also defines a new developer career that is independent of the traditional career
within companies. Researcher Dirk Riehle will lead a discussion about this new career,
and will argue that it creates economic value for some while it makes life harder for
others. Suggesting that such a career is worthwhile, the talk then discusses key
skills that a developer should possess or train in order to be successful in open
source projects.
