# Schedule

We are still in the process of building a world-class schedule of events for the Open Source in Business series. Topics we plan to explore include:

* How can companies build a business on open source projects?
* Is it harder to create an open source start-up in Europe?
* What is the role of venture capital investment in open source?
* How can I tell if an open source project will be around in 5 years?
* What is the role of foundations in open source?
* How can consortia help develop a commercial ecosystem around an open source project?

Stay tuned for the official series schedule, which will be posted here soon. If you have ideas for topics for discussion, [contact us](mailto:dneary@redhat.com) with your suggestions!
