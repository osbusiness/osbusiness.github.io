## Episode 6: Bootstrapping a Self-funded Open Source Company

**Time:** November 3rd, 2020, 4pm CET/11am EST/8am PST  
**Featured speakers:** Alison Gianotto, Roberto Galoppini

One common path for open source businesses is to start with a small number of
individual contributors, and self-fund the company. This week, Dave Neary will
explore this theme with two people who have taken different paths to starting a
business around an open source project, Alison Gianotto and Roberto Galoppini.

Alison Gianotto founded Grokability in 2015. The company is self-funded, and
its main product is a SaaS solution based on the open source project Snipe-IT,
developed by Alison.

After a career at Sourceforge.net, Roberto Galoppini started his own company
to help popular open source projects including Filezilla to create a
sustainable revenue model.

We will talk about the challenges of moving from an individual contributor to
a CEO role, growing a company organically and reaching profitability as
quickly as possible, and the revenue streams that are available to projects
in different stages of their life, and in different market segments.

## Episode 3: The Labor Economics of Open Source

**Time:** October 13th, 2020, 4pm CEST/11am EDT/8am PDT  
**Featured speakers:** Dirk Riehle, Alyssa Wright

Description: Open source is changing how software is built and how money is made. Open
source also defines a new developer career that is independent of the traditional career
within companies. Researcher Dirk Riehle and Alyssa Wright of the Open Collective will
lead a discussion about this new career, and will argue that it creates economic value
for some while it makes life harder for others. Suggesting that such a career is
worthwhile, the talk then discusses key skills that a developer should possess or train
in order to be successful in open source projects. We will also discuss how creators of
successful open source can develop a plan to earn a living while working on their
project.
