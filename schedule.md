**Featured speaker:** Stephen O'Grady  

{% include youtubeplayer.html id="xxDMqbe9Z2w" %}

Description: Industry analyst Stephen O'Grady from Redmonk will lead a presentation and
discussion on the way in which on-demand consumption of open source projects has changed
the nature of how people adopt open source, and the consequences that has for companies
building a business around products based on open source projects.

## Episode 3: The Labor Economics of Open Source

**Featured speakers:** Dirk Riehle, Alyssa Wright  

{% include youtubeplayer.html id="8MFaBVOfQ7c" %}

Description: Open source is changing how software is built and how money is made. Open
source also defines a new developer career that is independent of the traditional career
within companies. Researcher Dirk Riehle and Alyssa Wright of the Open Collective will
lead a discussion about this new career, and will argue that it creates economic value
for some while it makes life harder for others. Suggesting that such a career is
worthwhile, the talk then discusses key skills that a developer should possess or train
in order to be successful in open source projects. We will also discuss how creators of
successful open source can develop a plan to earn a living while working on their
project.

Join Dave Neary in a discussion with former CEO of Mozilla Corporation, John

## Episode 6: Bootstrapping a Self-funded Open Source Company

**Featured speakers:** Alison Gianotto, Roberto Galoppini  

{% include youtubeplayer.html id="aznZZTQwzOk" %}

One common path for open source businesses is to start with a small number of
individual contributors, and self-fund the company. This week, Dave Neary will
explore this theme with two people who have taken different paths to starting a
business around an open source project, Alison Gianotto and Roberto Galoppini.

Alison Gianotto founded Grokability in 2015. The company is self-funded, and
its main product is a SaaS solution based on the open source project Snipe-IT,
developed by Alison.

After a career at Sourceforge.net, Roberto Galoppini started his own company
to help popular open source projects including Filezilla to create a
sustainable revenue model.

We will talk about the challenges of moving from an individual contributor to
a CEO role, growing a company organically and reaching profitability as
quickly as possible, and the revenue streams that are available to projects
in different stages of their life, and in different market segments.

**Featured host:** Leslie Hawthorn  

{% include youtubeplayer.html id="kVTftGHhmPI" %}

Leslie Hawthorn is joined by experienced Open Source Consultants Aaron
Williamson, James Vasile, and Sumana Harihareswara to discuss the intricacies

their clients? How do they identify potential projects, and in what ways can
a consultant help improve the condition of their clients in open source? And
in a world where so much information is out there for free, how do you ensure
that you get paid?

## Episode 8: The Reinvention of the Eclipse Foundation

**Featured speaker:** Mike Milinkovich  
**Featured host:** Stephen Walli  

{% include youtubeplayer.html id="Z0rwuoVDzQ8" %}

The Eclipse Project was originally released in 2001, and led to the
creation of the Eclipse Foundation in 2004. Over the course of its
history, the Foundation has broadened its scope beyond the original
Eclipse IDE to include a broad range of developer tools, working
groups, and  now hosts over 350 open source projects. It has also
been successful in attracting a diverse set of member companies and
individuals.

The Foundation leadership announced in May 2020 that it planned to
become a Belgian non-profit, moving its home from the US to Europe.
In this episode, the Eclipse Foundation Mike Milinkovich will join
guest host Stephen Walli to discuss the historical and evolving
role of the Eclipse Foundation, the motivations for moving to
Europe now, and where he sees the Foundation going in the future.

## Episode 9: Why I won't start a company around Envoy

**Featured speaker:** Matt Klein  
**Featured host:** Matt Asay  

{% include youtubeplayer.html id="sC67lAgDtQc" %}

Many successful open source projects are created internally to
solve problems for a large company. Of these successful projects,
several project founders decide to start companies around the
commercialization of the project. But there are also project
founders who consciously decide not to go that route. 

Matt Klein, a software engineer with Lyft, wrote Envoy to scratch
a proverbial itch, to solve some of the problems of running
scalable distributed applications. After the project was open
sourced in 2016, it has had huge influence and traction,
including being adopted by the service mesh platform Istio.

In this episode, Matt will chat with guest host Matt Asay about
some of the reasons why [he has chosen not to strike out on his
own](https://medium.com/@mattklein123/optimizing-impact-why-i-will-not-start-an-envoy-platform-company-8904286658cb)
and attempt to create a service mesh business around his project.

## Episode 10: Open Source Hardware

**Featured speakers:** Alicia Gibb, Limor Fried, Jason Kridner  

{% include youtubeplayer.html id="qBvEcAyTmf0" %}

This week, Dave Neary is joined by Limor Fried of Adafruit, Alicia
Gibb of the Open Source Hardware Association, and Jason Kridner,
co-founder of the BeagleBoard.org project. We will discuss the
role that open source software development has played in enabling
an open hardware community to develop, and the role that open
source software plays in the economics of open hardware companies. 

This episode is our last episode of season 1! We will return with
a second season in the Spring.
