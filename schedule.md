## Episode 3: The Labor Economics of Open Source

**Time:** October 13th, 2020, 4pm CEST/11am EDT/8am PDT  
**Featured speakers:** Dirk Riehle, Alyssa Wright

Description: Open source is changing how software is built and how money is made. Open
source also defines a new developer career that is independent of the traditional career
within companies. Researcher Dirk Riehle and Alyssa Wright of the Open Collective will
lead a discussion about this new career, and will argue that it creates economic value
for some while it makes life harder for others. Suggesting that such a career is
worthwhile, the talk then discusses key skills that a developer should possess or train
in order to be successful in open source projects. We will also discuss how creators of
successful open source can develop a plan to earn a living while working on their
project.
