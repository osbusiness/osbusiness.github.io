**Featured speakers: Danese Cooper, NearForm, and Isabel Drost-Fromm, Europace** - Hosted by Leslie Hawthorn <br/>
**[Register now](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/innersource)**<br/>
**Date:** April 28, 2021, 9:00 am EDT

The term "InnerSource" was coined over twenty years ago to describe the practice of
adopting open source principles and methods inside organizations. The goals of
InnerSource are to encourage the breaking down of organizational siloes and to
improve communication and cooperation within a company.

In this episode, Leslie Hawthorn will host Danese Cooper of NearForm and Isabel
Drost-Fromm of Europace to discuss the benefits of InnerSource as a way to
accelerate culture change, and to encourage adoption of open tools, standards, and
best practices in software development in large organizations.

## Episode 8: How do you balance user and vendor interests? The Sakai Case Study

**Featured speaker: Dr. Charles Severance, University of Michigan** - Hosted by Dave Neary <br/>
**[Register now](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/sakai-case-study)**<br/>
**Date:** March 5, 2021, 11:00 am EDT

The Sakai project was created in 2004 by a group of universities who collaborated to create an open
source learning management system. By 2006, there was a clear need for an entity to coordinate the
community working on Sakai, and the Sakai Foundation was born. Our guest this week, Dr. Charles
Severance, became the founding Executive Director of the Foundation, having worked on the project
as Chief Architect since its creation.

Affectionately known as Dr. Chuck, he led the Foundation through those heady early days of growth,
competing with large, proprietary incumbents. He documented his experiences running the project and
the Foundation in his book, [Sakai: Building an Open Source Community](http://www.dr-chuck.com/sakai-book/).

In this episode, we will explore the difficulties around the commercialization of projects which
are created by users of the software without the resources or ability to provide support and
services for the project. We will revisit the early days of Sakai, the differing interests that
come into play when structuring a commercial market around a project, and the lessons that can be
learned from Dr. Chuck's experience with Sakai.

## Episode 1: The Open Source Database Market

**Featured speaker: Mårten Mickos** - Hosted by Dave Neary<br/>
**Recorded:** March 17, 2021, 5pm EDT<br/>
**[Watch video on demand now](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/open-source-database-market)**

Mårten Mickos joins Dave Neary to talk about the topical subject of the open source database market, and the economic realities of that business model. From the early days of open source databases like Ingres through MySQL and Sleepycat in the 2000s, to modern cloud native databases like ElasticSearch and MongoDB, open source database companies have struggled with the challenge of converting users of their free, open source projects into paying customers. We will discuss the business realities that have led the open source database market segment in particular to be an area ofexperimentation around using licensing and trademark in their business strategy. 


## Episode 2: The Business of Standards and Open Source

**Featured speakers: Guy Martin and Silona Bonewald** - Hosted by Stephen Walli<br/>

While technical standards and open source software development are both collaborative efforts involving representatives of diverse stakeholders, there have historically been significant cultural differences between open source communities and standards development organizations.

In recent years, however, standards bodies have increasingly embraced open source software development as an efficient way to develop implementations of emergent standards, and open source communities like the Eclipse Foundation have made the leap to become standards organizations.

In this episode, Silona Bonewald, the Executive Director of IEEE SA Open, and Guy Martin, the OASIS Executive Director, join Stephen Walli to discuss the drivers that lead companies to invest in the development of open standards, and in open source implementations of those standards, and to explore the history of both standards development and open source communities, and what the future looks like for both.

## Episode 3: Drupal: A case study in ecosystem development

**Featured speakers: Dries Buytaert, Heather Rocker** - Hosted by Dave Neary<br/>

Since being launched by Dries Buytaert from his college dorm, Drupal has become a massively successful open source content management platform, with an international ecosystem of commercial entities who benefit from, and contribute to the maintenance of, the shared platform.

With so many projects struggling with the transition from community-developed software to commercialization, Drupal stands out in its success. In this episode, I will be joined by Heather Rocker, Executive Director of the Drupal Association, and Dries Buytaert, Drupal creator and CTO of Acquia, to discuss how the project has navigated transitions which trip up so many other projects, including:

* Engaging commercial resellers and services companies in the ongoing development and maintenance of the open source project
* The transition of Dries from independent project founder to executive of a vendor offering Drupal services
* The creation of the Drupal Association as an independent non-profit to curate the Drupal project and community

Twenty years ago, studios working on Hollywood movies and other media developed much of their tooling in-house, or purchased proprietary off-the-shelf software. In recent years, however, studios are increasingly collaborating on open source libraries and tools for common needs, launching the Academy Software Foundation in 2018. Today, the media production industry working together on dozens of open source projects for applications including colour management, timeline editing, document interchange, rendering, and compositing.

For this episode, Carol Payne of Netflix and Larry Gritz of Sony Pictures Imageworks join us to discuss the technical and cultural changes that have led the media industry to embrace open source software in recent years, to discuss the role that open source plays today in media production, and the technological challenges facing the industry for the future.

## Episode 5: Venture Capital and Open Source

**Featured speakers: Astasia Myers, Redpoint Ventures, and Imran Ghory, Blossom Capital** - Hosted by Dave Neary<br/>
**[Register now](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/venture-capital-and-open-source)**<br/>
**Date:** April 14, 2021, 12:00 noon EDT

The role of venture capital in scaling young companies is critical. It provides
resources to hire people, scale sales and marketing efforts to reach new audiences,
and to provide runway for future development plans.  However, the constraints
involved in meeting the expectations of a high  valuation can sometimes lead to
uncomfortable tension between project  early adopters and the growth of a company.

In this episode, Astasia Myers of Redpoint Ventures and Imran Ghory of Blossom
Capital will discuss what makes an attractive investment  opportunity in an open
source company, what measures are important for  valuation and growth, and the
importance of open source in early growth  and finding the right business model.

## Episode 6: The Role of Open Source Program Offices Outside the Software Industry

**Featured speakers: Nithya Ruff, Comcast, and Gil Yehuda, U.S. Bank** - Hosted by Dave Neary <br/>
**[Register now](https://www.crowdcast.io/e/role-of-ospos)**<br/>
**Date:** April 21, 2021, 11:00 am EDT

In recent years, more and more companies have been creating an Open Source Program
Office (OSPO) in industries far outside the traditional software sector. Banks,
insurance companies, telecommunications companies, oil and gas companies, and others
have created this function to guide the evolution of how software is produced and
consumed by these companies.

In this episode, Dave Neary will be joined by Nithya Ruff, Executive Director of
the Open Source Program Office of Comcast and chair of the board of the Linux
Foundation, and Gil Yehuda, Head of Open Source Engineering and Technology at U.S.
Bank, to discuss the pivotal role that Open Source Program Offices have played in
evolving attitudes to the risks of consuming open source software and enabling their
engineers to develop and contribute to open source projects.

We will talk about the key stakeholders for an OSPO in a large company, and whether
they have faced similar challenges in helping their companies evolve over the years.
We will discuss the differences between traditional open source technology
companies and working in an industry where technology is an enabler of customer
value, rather than the primary driver of revenue. Finally, we will discuss where we
see open source developing in the future, and some resources that are available to
companies interested in starting an OSPO of their own.
