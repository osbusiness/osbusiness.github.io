Mårten Mickos joins Dave Neary to talk about the topical subject of the open source database market, and the economic realities of that business model. From the early days of open source databases like Ingres through MySQL and Sleepycat in the 2000s, to modern cloud native databases like ElasticSearch and MongoDB, open source database companies have struggled with the challenge of converting users of their free, open source projects into paying customers. We will discuss the business realities that have led the open source database market segment in particular to be an area ofexperimentation around using licensing and trademark in their business strategy.

While technical standards and open source software development are both collaborative efforts involving representatives of diverse stakeholders, there have historically been significant cultural differences between open source communities and standards development organizations.

In recent years, however, standards bodies have increasingly embraced open source software development as an efficient way to develop implementations of emergent standards, and open source communities like the Eclipse Foundation have made the leap to become standards organizations.

In this episode, Silona Bonewald, the Executive Director of IEEE SA Open, and Guy Martin, the OASIS Executive Director, join Stephen Walli to discuss the drivers that lead companies to invest in the development of open standards, and in open source implementations of those standards, and to explore the history of both standards development and open source communities, and what the future looks like for both.

Since being launched by Dries Buytaert from his college dorm, Drupal has become a massively successful open source content management platform, with an international ecosystem of commercial entities who benefit from, and contribute to the maintenance of, the shared platform.

With so many projects struggling with the transition from community-developed software to commercialization, Drupal stands out in its success. In this episode, I will be joined by Heather Rocker, Executive Director of the Drupal Association, and Dries Buytaert, Drupal creator and CTO of Acquia, to discuss how the project has navigated transitions which trip up so many other projects, including:

* Engaging commercial resellers and services companies in the ongoing development and maintenance of the open source project
* The transition of Dries from independent project founder to executive of a vendor offering Drupal services
* The creation of the Drupal Association as an independent non-profit to curate the Drupal project and community

Twenty years ago, studios working on Hollywood movies and other media developed much of their tooling in-house, or purchased proprietary off-the-shelf software. In recent years, however, studios are increasingly collaborating on open source libraries and tools for common needs, launching the Academy Software Foundation in 2018. Today, the media production industry working together on dozens of open source projects for applications including colour management, timeline editing, document interchange, rendering, and compositing.

For this episode, Carol Payne of Netflix and Larry Gritz of Sony Pictures Imageworks join us to discuss the technical and cultural changes that have led the media industry to embrace open source software in recent years, to discuss the role that open source plays today in media production, and the technological challenges facing the industry for the future.
